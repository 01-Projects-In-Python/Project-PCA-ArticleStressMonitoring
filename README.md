Purpose:
Explore methods to reduce dimensions for the physiological signals dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Objectives:
  
1. EDA<br>
2. Identify ways to reduce dimensions of the datasets.<br>
3. Implement PCA to reduce the dataset's dimensions.<br>
4. Conduct the prediction tasks using the linear model. <br>
5. Interpret the result of the predictions.<br>
6. Compare the results of the model with the initial dataset vs the dataset reduced.<br>
7. Conclusions.<br>}
